# dome

"Startpage - Autocomplete, arrow keys, responsive."

this is a fork of dome, for the following purposes:
- make it easier to read by using pug and sass
- make it identify urls rather than just search queries
- make it easier to add/delete bookmarks
- make it prettier
- make it format to different screen sizes
- add certain widgets, like weather.
- add ability to link to internal browser settings << this isn't gonna work unless this project becomes an extention... debating if I should
- add ability to link to local files
- add fuzzy search results from the search engine of choice

pretty much none of these features are implemented yet, I've just started working on this in my free time. 

implemented features:
- formatting errors fixed
- easier to read (pug + sass support)
- clock now does not display seconds, displays 12-hour 
- some portions of the html stretch to fit.
- sites are now located in their own file so adding/deleting bookmarks, as well as updating the website, is now easier.
